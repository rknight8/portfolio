<p>
  AJ's Lite Bites, a small café, asked for a visual identity design to suit the needs of their business. I really enjoyed working on this project because it involved working with a range of print media. From business cards to a pop-up banner, each piece of print media was uniquely designed to match the client's specification.
</p>
<p>
  Talking with the client, the requirements of the design were identified. One of the important elements was colour. The client requested an mono colour scheme consisting of warm colours, in particular the colour orange. It was vital for the brand to appear professional and friendly to draw in customers from nearby businesses and locals.
</p>
<h2>The Design</h2>
<p>
  Going for a minimal approach, a simple coffee cup was created to be the forefront of the logo design. The floating style and the bite mark is a visual representation of the café name. The orange was used to draw attention to particular elements and highlight information. The design uses a dark background to create a bold effect with the colour.
