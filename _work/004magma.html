<p>
  Magma Machine was a small graphic and digital design partnership ran by myself and my partner. First established during my time at college it was a fun business to get a taste
  of the working environment and gain experience. During my time with Magma Machine I learned a lot of new skills, from client communication and working with the Adobe Suite. It was
  only due to education commitments did Magma Machine have to close.

<h2>The Name</h2>
<p>
  While deciding on a name for our business I listened to the podcast series, Adventures In Design hosted by Mark Brickey. The podcast itself covers a wide range of topics relating to graphic design (I highly
  recommened giving it a listen!). While listening to came up with the name 'Magma Machine' as we wanted to stand out amoungst other creative design businesses. By listening to the
  podcast and hearing other unique business names we got the courage to go ahead with the name.

<h2>The Design</h2>
<p>
  With magma in the name we naturally chose a warm colour scheme. Putting it against a dark backdrop highlighted the magma effect. The cog represents the 'machine' part of the design and brings all of the elements together. The brand design
  of Magma Machine is to showcase to potential clients that we weren't afraid to work with unique projects and think outside the box. A variant of the logo design was developed
  for when the illustration logo design was not suitable e.g. business cards, files, etc.

<p>
  We took the minimalist approach for the brand identity and brand assets. This was achieved through the use of white space and modern typefaces. Colours were used to determine
  key elements and features and draw attention to certain elements.

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Sadly, there are no current future plans for Magma Machine. It was a fun partnership to run and I learned many things while it was active. It gave me confidence talking to 
  clients and talking about my own work. However, it was necessary to end Magma Machine due to other commitments. That is not to say Magma Machine may not be revived some time
  in the future.
