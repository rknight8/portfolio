  For a design challenge, I was tasked with designing a mobile banking app aimed at young people. The app was aimed at young people as a means to use banking on the go.
  To create the designs, I used Figma, an interface design tool similar to Sketch. Additionally, I used InVision to create a simple demo of the application and how it may work were
  it live.

<div class="flex-column img-container winter-img">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/winter/Start.jpg" alt="start screen"><br />
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/winter/Account.jpg" alt="account screen"><br />
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/winter/Transfer-from.jpg" alt="transfer screen"><br />
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/winter/Support.jpg" alt="support screen">
</div>

  I researched a wide range of banking apps used throughout the UK, taking note of the colours and styling of each. I stuck with a cool colour theme to give a professional
  approach to the app and to reference back to the bank name. Rounded corners on elements softens the style to make the design less harsh. Colours were used to highlight
  different elements to draw subtle attention e.g. lighter blues to highlight transactions.

  While I am happy with the overall design there is many areas I can improve on. Despite it only being practice I found this exercising enjoyable it has
  outlined parts in which I can improve on both my way of working and my designs.
