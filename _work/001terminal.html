  <p>
    Terminal Velocity is a text-adventure game developed using web technologies. It was developed as a part of my honours project for university. I had previously developed a similar project using Python Flask and Ajax. However, this time I wanted to experiment with something different. As I wanted to expand my knowledge on the fundamentals of web technologies I decided to develop my project using a variety of technologies such as: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll and Flexbox.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to bring together my love of retro text-adventure games (Zork series being one of my main inspirations) to the web so it would be readily available to those with internet access. Although not as popular as they once were, I found text-adventures were making a comeback in the video games industry, for instance in the indie video game 'Stories Untold' and in the form of mini-games in 'Saint Row IV'.

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>
    The design of the project was just as important as the development. Since text-adventure games gained mainstream popularity in the 1980's it felt only right to design my project around 80's aesthetics. Inspiration for the design was not limited to the text games of the 1980's. I researched films and modern space designs to bring the two seemingly unrelated design areas together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The film 'Alien' proved to be a great source of inspiration for my logo design. I was greatly inspired by the uniform design the Nostromo crew wear throughout the film. In particular it was the Nostromo badge featured on the uniform that captured my attention.
    <br>
    I took note of the shape, colours and simplistic details of the design from the film. The idea was to keep the shape in-line with a patch that could potentially be used on a space uniform. I purposely researched 80's sci-fi for the logo as I felt it was important to step away from modern space designs to differentiate from existing designs.

  <h2>Mobile First</h2>
  <p>
    As more and more users are using mobile phones, I wanted to adopt the mobile first approach. My honours project presented an opportunity to do so. Initially, I found mobile first to be very limiting in terms of what elements I could use and how they would appear on screen. Over time, I found I much preffered the mobile first approach as it meant I did not have unneccesary elements in my work.
