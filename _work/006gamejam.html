<p>
  Myself, and 4 other people made up our team for the 2021 global game jam. Our team name was the 8-bit Knights. I created a small knight logo that I then scattered around different rooms of our game (see if you can find it below!).
  <br />
  The game concept was simple; you play as a janitor in a school who is working night-shift. The janitor, remembering his wife who was murdered in the school,  goes to work only to find his wife’s shoe in one of the halls.
  With signs of a break-in, you have to investigate the rest of the school to find out what happened.

  Below are some examples of the level design I worked on.

<div class="img-container flex-column" id="img-catalogue">
  <p>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gamejam/Classrooms.jpg" alt="classroom level">
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gamejam/Basement.jpg" alt="basement level">
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img//gamejam/storeroom.jpg" alt="storeroom level">
  </p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img//gamejam/map.jpg" alt="map design">

  </p>
</div>

My role was to create the art assets within the game environment and build out the level. 
Taking inspiration from games such as Darkwood, Little Nightmares and Silent Hill series, I went for a decrepit style. Keeping to the horror theme, I used dull colour schemes to maintain a dark atmosphere.
For the map design, I took direct inspiration from the game Silent Hill 4 - in which the main character ‘draws’ his own map in his journal. To re-create this effect, I drew out the map freehand using a graphics tablet.
<br />
Although this was my first game jam, I had a lot of fun working with the rest of the team and creating a game together.
I learned a lot in a short period of time, from learning more about level design to getting to know Game Maker. I will definitely be aiming to work on other game jams in the future.
