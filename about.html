<p>
  Hi! I'm Rebecca and I graduated from Edinburgh Napier University with a 2:1 bachelor's degree. I'm currently working as a junior software engingeer for a small company.
  <br />
  I discovered my love for web design while studying in college and working on some freelance projects.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not developing I'm usually playing video games, drawing, or painting tabletop miniatures.
