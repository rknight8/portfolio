<p>
  Hi! I'm Rebecca and I have just recently graduated from Edinburgh Napier University with a 2:1 bachelor's degree.
  <br />
  I discovered my love for web design while studying in college and working on some freelance projects.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not developing I'm usually playing video games, drawing, learning Spanish or painting miniatures.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I'm looking for work in the web development industry with a focus on front-end and UX design.
